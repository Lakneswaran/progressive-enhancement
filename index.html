     <h2>The story</h2>
    
         <!--Once upon a time --> <img id="time" src="Once_Upon_A_Time_logo.svg" alt="once upon a time">
         <p class="chinesefarmer"> there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong> <br>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong> <br>
    
        The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too <mark>bad</mark>,</q> and the farmer responded, <strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong><br> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <strong><q>Maybe.</q></strong></p>
    
         <p class="quote">The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <em>good</em> or <mark>bad</mark> —<br> because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <em>good</em>em fortune.</p>

        <p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are <em>good</em> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <em>good</em> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
