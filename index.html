     <h2>The story</h2>
    
     <!--Once upon a time --> <img id="time" src="Once_Upon_A_Time_logo.svg" alt="once upon a time">
     <p class="chinesefarmer"> there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q>Maybe.</q> <br>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q>Maybe.</q> <br>
    
    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q>Maybe.</q><br> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q>Maybe.</q></p>
    
    <p class="quote">The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad —<br> because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.</p>

    Conclusion  
    Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
